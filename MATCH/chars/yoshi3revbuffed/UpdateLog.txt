Version 1.2+1 Update                 01/14/11
-------------------------------------------------
[SYS]Added Negative Edge. For those who don't know,
this basically means you can use special moves by either pushing
or releasing a button. For example, a hadoken can be
used by either doing a down->forward motion then pressing
a punch button, or doing a down->forward motion and
releasing a punch button.
[SYS]Added a new Dive Roll mechanic. A full explanation
is in the readme.
[SYS]Added damage reduction.
[SYS]Decided to go the SVC route and changed it so that his
forward throw is LP+LK, and his backward throw is SP+SK.
[BUFF]AI!!! >:D (Well a start anyway lol. Seriously
though I'm pretty lost as far as AI goes, so any
feedback/pointers will be greatly appreciated.)
[BUFF]Standing Strong Punch has a longer hitpause, and
a slightly increased damage output.
[BUFF]Egg throw comes out slightly faster.
[BUFF]Chained SK has a slightly longer hitstun, making it possible to combo
from (if you're fast enough :P).
[BUFF]Fire Breath has a higher damage output.
[BUFF]Added a couple new air command moves, Tail Slash, and Double Kick.
[BUFF]Changed the way the start-up for Yoshi Stampede
connects. Instead of running into the enemy and then
uppercutting them, now he'll throw an uppercut once
he gets to a certain distance from the enemy. Basically
it's a bit harder to avoid now.
[BUFF]Ranged grab has gained a small amount of blockstun.
[NERF]Lowered his walking speed.
[NERF]Ground Pound falls a little slower, and it is a little more noticable.
[NERF]Low Tail Strike is a little slower.
[NERF]Yoshi Stampede has a slightly lower
damage output.
[NERF]Egg Roll and EX Egg Roll have a longer
recover time.
[BUFF/NERF]LP Egg throw flies slightly lower, but also
goes a little further.
[BUFF/NERF]Lowered the priority on the attack at
the start of Yoshi Bomb, but I also extended the
attack window, both reach wise and time wise.
[BUFF/NERF]Made Metal Yoshi more boss-ish. A full 
explanation on the changes is in the readme.
[FIX]Backwards ranged grab didn't hit aerial opponents like it was 
supposed to.
[FIX]Made the Fire Breath command stricter, there were
times where it would activate at random.
[FIX]Fixed Metal Yoshi's gravity modifier, so
he won't go through the floor during grabs.
[FIX]Created a custom state for when the enemy is
being trampled during Yoshi Stampede, there were
times where the enemy would get up too early and
the attack wouldn't finish correctly.
[MISC]Made a lot of subtle changes to the stampede
itself. I reduced the amount of screen shaking,
the Yoshis run a little slower, and I balanced out
the amount of stepping sounds, since before too many
would play at once causing other sounds to not play
at all. I also added a low tremor sound in the
background. All in all I think it looks more...
presentable :D
[MISC]New sprites and animations in some spots, but
I'll leave you to figure those out :P
[MISC]Re-organized the readme a bit.
-------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1 Update                  08/09/10
-------------------------------------------------
[BUFF]Fire Breath comes out a little faster now.
[BUFF]Low Tail Strike can now hit downed opponents.
[BUFF]Super Fire Breath's damage is increased.
[FIX]Removed the infinite priority in the Yoshi
Stampede start-up movement.
[FIX]Smash Headbutt's auto-block feature only
guards 1 hit, as opposed to before where it makes
him invincible.
[FIX]Adjusted the throw hitbox, as there were times
where the throw would miss if the enemy was too
close.
[FIX]Adjusted the clsn's of several animations
[MISC]Changed the Large Portrait, but I included the
old one (portrait2.pcx) in the graphics folder in 
case you wanted to switch back.  
[MISC]Made it so you could cancel into a jump after
hitting an enemy with a launcher. This makes it easier
to start an air-combo.
[MISC]As requested, Yoshi Stampede has multi-colored
Yoshis. Unlike before where they only matched your 
palette.
