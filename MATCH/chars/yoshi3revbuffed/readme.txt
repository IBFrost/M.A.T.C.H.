   /  Another Yoshi                 /
  /    Version - 1.2+1             /
 /       Made by Mike S. Densky   /
/--------------------------------/

Key:
LP = x       S = Start
SP = y      *D = down
LK = a      *F = forward
SK = b      *B = back
P = x-or-y  *U = up
K = a-or-b

SE = Super Energy
SE Stock = 1 Lvl on the Super Bar/1000 SE

*A combination of the two denotes a diagonal
DF = down-forward diagonal for instance.
Example: Hadoken: D,DF,F,P

-------------------------------------------------
Basic System Workings
-------------------------------------------------
Double Jump: (Air) U
-Self explanatory

Run: F,F
-Self explanatory

Back Dash: B,B
-A short hop backwards, good for a quick retreat.

Grab: LK+LP
Turn Grab: SP+SK
-Unblockable attacks performed next to the
opponent, mostly as punishment for turtle-ing.
*Yoshi's grabs work slightly different than usual,
if his opponent isn't close enough to grab he will
send his tounge out to try and grab them. His grab
is blockable once he sends out his tounge, but it will
also be able to hit an enemy in the air.

Dive Roll
-While running, press down or down forward to do a quick
roll. The roll goes through most high attacks and projectiles,
but can be risky, because you don't have any control
while rolling. You will end up in a crouching position
after the roll ends.

Recovery Roll
-While downed, hold either Forward or Back to roll
in that direction when you get up.

Basic Chaining
-You can link basic+command moves together, from light->Strong.
-Normals + Commands -> Specials, Supers, or the Ultimate Attack.
Ex. LP->SP or SK, A.LP->A.SP or SK, C.LK->C.SK or C.SP
    LP->SP->Special

Metal Yoshi
--------------------------------------------------
Metal Yoshi is a mid-boss version based on the
Metal characters from Super Smash Bros.

-Super Armor
-His AI is slightly different.
-No damage dampening :P
-Standing Strong Punch is slower, but it is a lot
stronger and sends the foe flying.
-Tail Slash slams the opponent to the ground even
if standing.
-Both Strong and EX headbutts are unblockable, and
send the enemy to the "wall."
-He has a higher level of gravity. Making him hard
to throw, but at the same time he is pretty much
ground bound.
-A much slower walking speed.
-Super Yoshi Bomb/Super Ground Pound creates multiple
shockwaves.
-He can't use Yoshi Stampede.
-He has some other weaknesses too, but where's the
fun in telling you? :P
