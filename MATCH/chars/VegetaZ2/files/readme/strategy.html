Vegeta's a nasty piece of work if used correctly. He can zone you out with his Ki Blasts and Rising Knee Arrow or rush you down and force mistakes with his Wolverine Flips and their follow-ups. He can switch from zoning to rushdown in the blink of an eye by canceling his Machine Gun Temper into Sliding Kick. Vegeta's very good at keeping you on your toes and making sure the fight happens on his terms. Use and abuse his tools correctly and you'll be a force to be reckoned with.</p>

He's not perfect, however. His damage output is not exactly high without the corner and some meter, so you'll want to abuse every combo opportunity you're given. His supers can't always be used in midscreen combos, so the corner is the Prince's best friend in pressuring the opponent. His defense is also lower than average, so being caught in a longer combo can be a nightmare for you. Just be careful when forcing your opponent to be careful and you'll remember why Vegeta's the Prince of all Saiyans.

<h2>System Notes</h2>

<b>Power Charge:</b><br>
This is a very reliable standby when zoning. If you knock the enemy down with an EX Ki Blast or something, you can charge up your power while the enemy's trying to get up and at you since you're wide open when you charge.<br>

<br>
<b>Focus Hammer:</b><br>
This move is nice if you think the enemy's going to attack and you don't want to risk a Rising Knee Arrow or a Wolverine Flip. He's got Super Armor during the charging and he can combo afterwards if you dash cancel it just right. If you're in a fireball war, this can knock their projectiles right back at them, making Vegeta that much more difficult to out-zone.<br>

<br>
<b>Negative Edge:</b><br>
It's not really a move, but it deserves mention. You can hold down a button, do the motion, and let go of the button to do a special move. It doesn't work for EX Specials and Supers that use more than one button, but quick fingers should help with that.<br>


<br>
<br>

<hr>
<h2>Notable Normals</h3>

<b>Dash Elbow:</b><br>
This is a nice move to use when you want to dodge an opponent's attack and retaliate with a combo since it can be chained into all mediums. It's even safe on block at a minimum of +1 frames if used from as close as possible and a maximum of +10 frames if used from nearly full screen.<br>

<br>
<b>Sliding Kick:</b><br>
This move is nice to use if you think your opponent's going to punch you as you run up since he slides underneath most attacks. He can also jump cancel it and follow up with some combos. It's not exactly safe on block, so you can get punished for a bad guess.<br>

<br>
<b>Standing C:</b><br>
This move can chain into itself, but it'll knock down on the third hit. It has a nice place in grounded hitconfirms and also can go over some lows. It's best to follow this one with Wolverine Flip Forward and one of its follow ups because Negative Edge will make that easy.<br>

<br>
<b>Air C:</b><br>
Here's Vegeta's standard way to end an air combo as well as jumping in tool. It knocks down, so there's no real way to combo after it. However, if you hit an aerial opponent with it, they'll bounce off the ground (unless the combo's gone on for too long or you've already used it) and you can keep comboing them.<br>

<br>
<b>Taunt:</b><br>
Vegeta doesn't like fools blabbing incessantly, so he occasionally feels the need to tell you to shut up, fool! Makes a nice retort to the other player's taunts and also can be used to rub salt into a wounded foe's wounds.



<br>
<br>

<hr>
<h2>Specials</h4>

<b>Ki Blast:</b><br>
Vegeta's basic zoning tool. You can chain this into a second Ki Blast, as well, making him able to control a very nice amount of space. He can also cancel it into various things, but the movelist already says what's possible so I don't need to tell you twice. Charging a Ki Blast can also be handy if you've knocked the opponent down and want to greet them with a blast. The EX version knocks down as well, putting Vegeta at a good advantage.<br>

<br>
<b>Wolverine Flip:</b><br>
This is one of Vegeta's most important tools since he's invincible and can follow up with a knockdown. The stronger versions leap farther back, so you'll want to use different versions depending on if you just want to hit your opponent out of a move or just run away.<br>

<br>
<b>Wolverine Flip Forward:</b><br>
Imagine Wolverine Flip. Now imagine it going forward with no invincibility. That's this move in a nutshell. It's nice for grounded combos because its follow ups knock down and Wolverine Dashing Elbow can cancel into Bakuhatsuha. The stronger versions send him farther forward, but it's good enough just to use the Heavy version.<br>

<br>
<b>Wolverine Sweep:</b><br>
This move hits low and knocks the opponent down. If you've trained your opponent to block high because of Wolverine Dashing Elbow, pull this move out once in a while to trip them up and then down. Just don't mind how atrociously unsafe this move is on block. Seriously, it's awful when blocked.<br>

<br>
<b>Wolverine Dashing Elbow:</b><br>
If you want to push your opponent as far away as possible, this is the move to use. He can also super cancel without a problem.<br>

<br>
<b>Explosion Grab:</b><br>
This move is extremely weak in every fashion but one. In other words, it's unblockable. If you have an opponent guarding even your masterful mix-ups, start using this move. It basically does chip damage, but it's essential to break a turtle's defense.<br>

<br>
<b>Wolverine Displacement:</b><br>
Vegeta can also dash or super jump after Wolverine Dash. You can put additional space between Vegeta and his opponent or dash forward and start rushing them down. You can't dash forward after Wolverine Flip Forward, so there's that. The jumping option is nice if you predict that they'll try to attack you and you can greet them with a Bakuhatsuha.<br>

<br>
<b>Machine Gun Temper:</b><br>
Here's another nice zoning tool for him. He can eat through your attempts to outzone him and even combo out of it by canceling it into Sliding Kick. He can also super cancel this into the different versions of Bakuhatsuha and Galick Ho, so it's a versatile move in and out of combos. The EX version launches a massive six blasts, so you'll have a hard time getting to him if he's got meter.<br>

<br>
<b>Aerial Machine Gun Temper:</b><br>
Vegeta's a dirty fighter and it shows. He can jump above you and throw blasts down, letting him start a combo. The Light version is best for this because he stops moving and just drops on down. The EX version can only be used in Rage mode (what) and launches five blasts, controlling an impressive amount of space. He can also cancel this into Galick Ho for some OTG fun.<br>

<br>
<b>Rising Knee Arrow:</b><br>
Here's one thing Goku doesn't have: an invincible meterless anti-air. He can use it to blow through your opponent's attempts to jump at you and otherwise just blow through their attacks. He can cancel it into Galactic Gunfire as well, making it the only way to use it in the air (what) along with the various versions of Bakuhatsuha.<br>

<br>
<b>Bomber Kick:</b><br>
If you don't want to spend meter after Rising Knee Arrow, you'll want to follow up into this. It tacks on some extra damage and knocks the opponent back so you can start zoning them.


<br>
<br>

<hr>
<h2>Supers</h5>

<b>Galick Ho:</b><br>
Here's one of his zoning tools if you see they're launching a lot of fireballs at you and you don't think Machine Gun Temper's one-by-one approach will cut it. He can also use it in the air to rain pain directly beneath him. The Chou variant does a cool 20 hits to blow through nearly anything the opponent can dare throw at you. The lvl 1 variant can also cancel into Chou Galick Ho.<br>

<br>
<b>Bakuhatsuha:</b><br>
Here's a move that controls a nice bit of space. It's invincible and knocks the opponent away, allowing some more zoning. If you can land this in the corner, you can combo out of it. Rising Knee Arrow can also loop into this until he's out of meter as long as he's in the corner. The lvl 2 version launches the opponent higher and controls even more space. Same deal with the lvl 3 version, nothing else new.<br>

<br>
<b>Rage Mode:</b><br>
This move is a bit of a double-edged sword. On one hand, you can freely spam EX fireballs and enjoy a new move along with unblockable Galactic Gunfire. On the other hand, no more Wolverine Flip and no Power Charge. It's not really possible to combo into this, so you'll need to make sure you're launching projectile after projectile at the opponent, never giving them a chance to breathe. You need to fill the Kanji up at least one level to use Galactic Gunfire, which costs just one meter in this mode. Each level will result in a new finisher for Galatic Gunfire and more damage.<br>

<br>
<b>Final Flash:</b><br>
This move controls a monstrous amount of space and is invincible at the start. He's not invincible when he's going back, so make sure to have a blast or two on screen when you whip this move out.<br>

<br>
<b>Galactic Gunfire:</b><br>
This is Vegeta's strongest super, but that's only true if you mash to get all 52 hits. He is invincible during the immensely quick startup and also has one hit of super armor while charging. If you charge all the way, it's unblockable. Don't expect to pull this off, it takes far too long. It can only be used in the air if canceled from Rising Knee Arrow. It's also quite easy to combo into, even in Rage Mode.<br>


<br>

<h2>Combos:</h2>
<p>Vegeta's combos are pretty strong, but he needs meter and or the opponent to be in the corner to really unleash the hurt. The combos are extremely pliable and open to experimenting, so don't set your options in stone.</p>

- X, Y, B, Z, C Wolverine Flip Forward, Wolverine Dashing Elbow, Galick Ho<br>
<font color="FF0000">329 Damage</font><br>
<font color="009900">1 Meter</font><br>
Here's a basic midscreen combo for ya. It's got some time for hit-confirms so you don't need to commit to anything if you're judicious with your attacks. Also, you could replace Galick Ho with Chou Galick Ho for a sweet 392 damage.<br><br>

- X, Y, B, Z, Ki Blast, Ki Blast, EX Machine Gun Temper, Sliding Kick, Air Y, Air Y, Air C, Z, C Rising Knee Arrow, Bomber Kick.<br>
<font color="FF0000">342 Damage</font><br>
<font color="009900">1/2 Meter</font><br>
Here's a more complex (and less expensive) version of the previous combo. It's got great corner carry and is almost self-sufficient. Bomber Kick can be replaced with a variant of Bakuhatsuha if you feel like setting up some corner loops or just want to kill your opponent.<br><br>

- Y, B, C, C, C Wolverine Flip Forward, Wolverine Dashing Elbow, lvl 2 Bakuhatsuha, Ki Blast, Ki Blast, Galick Ho<br>
<font color="FF0000">573 Damage</font><br>
<font color="009900">3 Meter</font><br>
It's costly, sure, but it's really easy to set this one up. The only real troubles pulling this one off are the cancel into Bakuhatsuha and juggling with the Ki Blasts. It becomes easy enough after a while.<br><br>

- Y, B, Z, Ki Blast, Ki Blast, EX Machine Gun Temper,Sliding Kick, Air Y, Air Y, Air C, Z, C Rising Knee Arrow, lvl 1 Bakuhatsuha, C Rising Knee Arrow, lvl 1 Bakuhatsuha, C Rising Knee Arrow, lvl 1 Bakuhatsuha, C Rising Knee Arrow, Bomber Kick<br>
<font color="FF0000">425 Damage</font><br>
<font color="009900">3 Meter</font><br>
Sure, it's a criminally inefficient combo, but it's incredibly styling. Besides, you can also run the clock out pretty well if you manage to land this.<br><br>
