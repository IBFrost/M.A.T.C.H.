<br><img src="images/marker.png" border="0" height="13" width="14"><b>New stuff :</b><br>


<br><img src="images/marker.png" border="0" height="13" width="14"><b>Graphics and Sounds :</b><br>
- 8 new palettes : Blue_Sun_Studios-Alucard, Blue_Sun_Studios-The_Devils_Corpse_False_SSJ, Bomberman-HeyDidyaWannaGoKartRacin, Bomberman-IdOughtToBeOnABaseballCard, Bomberman-LossOfAppitite, Bomberman-SpacePwncess, Bomberman-SparklePrince, Bomberman-StepItUp.<br>

<br><img src="images/marker.png" border="0" height="13" width="14"><b>Gameplay Fixes :</b><br>

- Startup on throws reduced to 4 ticks, and recovery time set up to 18 ticks.<br>

- Low Zero Counter makes P2 go much lower in the air, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMBeU7dq-24">avoiding Ki Blast loops</a>.<br>

- Sliding Kick can't be jump cancelled into, when P2 has blocked Sliding Kick. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejFT8dPO3Ks">This fixes blockstring problems</a>.<br>
- Set the juggle points for Sliding Kick to 7 instead of 0, which should fix the infinites by making them whiff.<br>
- Removed Ki Blast knocking down air opponents, apart from MAX charged Ki Blasts.<br>
- Increased recovery time on 2nd Ki Blast to avoid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYIXO3n_cI">a Ki Blast infinite [Ki Blast+HP, Ki Blast+LP]</a>.<br>
- Air Machine Gun Temper has less guard pausetime/hittime/slidetime to make it less safe when performed on a guarding opponent.<br>
- Added recovery time to Air Machine Gun Temper (state 1740). No more comboability for this move.<br>
- Knee Arrow is now cancellable into Air (Chou) Galick Ho.<br>
- Added a landing state (which gives more recovery time) to Air (Chou) Galick Ho.<br>
- Air (Chou) Galick Ho is now an OTG.<br>

- Rage Galactic Gunfire is now blockable.<br>
