		<b>Balthazar's Introduction</b><br><br>
	
Vegeta Z2 ? The next logical step after the succes of Goku Z2! Both me and Cybaster's Mugen spirits are still high, therefore we want to continue contributing to the Mugen community with our original brand of Z2 characters.<br><br>

Vegeta is probably the most popular character in Dragonball Z, would one dive into statistics, ratings or whatnot. And there's a good reason for his popularity : he's pretty much an arrogant basterd, but what a cool one.<br>
He's displayed a varied arsenal of special moves throughout the series, which was our main source of inspiration.<br><br>

Vegeta will be built upon the now set system basics introduced with Goku. We did our best to keep him both faithful to the Z2 system, while at the same time having a different gameplay approach. The Saiyan Prince will have lots of energy projectiles up his sleeve, and play more with zoning and tricking the enemy.<br><br>

I've had fun creating Vegeta, he's turned out wonderful. :D<br><br>

I have always wondered how Akira Toriyama's reaction would be, seeing his characters brought to life in such an ass-kicking way, by a few fanboys, rather than a professional development studio. If I'm truly honest, I'd say we did a better job than those guys anyway. :P<br><br>

Special word out to Mick Lauer, a.k.a. Rice Pirate, a professional voice actor who was willing to contribute to Vegeta Z2 by recording all required voice files for him, in his own unique take on the character, free of charge. Thank you!<br><br>

We made this character for everyone who likes DBZ, but moreso for everybody who can appreciate a well-balanced and fun-to-play as character. Support us, and we'll be reaching out for another Character of the Year award!<br><br>

	<b>Cybaster's Introduction</b><br><br>

Once again, not much to add to what Balthazar said.<br><br>

The very first version of Vegeta Z2 was released as a punching bag version, as Balthazar had lost motivation spriting him, due to some over ambitious color separation. I started working on Gohan Z2, while the Prince of Saiyans took dust. However, a few months later, Balthazar came back with a new simplified yet kickass design for Vegeta, and Vegeta was back to track !<br><br>

Getting him started was much simpler, since Goku Z2 could be used as a base for coding, and all the system stuff and effects were already in. Challenge came during specials and supers, to make all the combos flow perfectly and feel natural. I think we've done a good job with this.<br><br>

I hope you'll enjoy playing with vegeta Z2 as much as we did creating him.<br><br>

<hr>

If you find infinites, please report.<br>
If you think some moves or combos are really unbalanced, please report or contact me, I will see what I can do.<br><br>

Note that this character was built for Winmugen (Plus). At this point, I cannot ensure everything will work correctly in Mugen 1.0, moreover in widescreen resolution. It will definitely have bugs if you play with it using Mugen 1.1, since the zooming feature isn't taken into account in this version of Vegeta Z2.<br><br>
