This palette patch fixes the issues with Garadevoir's palettes in M.U.G.E.N 1.0, where only the first palette would show up regardless of which button was pressed (technically none of the palettes work, as M.U.G.E.N actually reads off the palette data from sprite 9000,0, which is why the Gallade assist displays incorrectly). This patch also fixes some transparency errors with Gardevoir's animations.

==Installation==
-Copy the Gardevoir folder from "GardevoirPalettePatch.zip". This folder contains "Gardevoir.air" and "Gardevoir.sff".
-Paste the folder into your M.U.G.E.N's "chars" folder, and agree to replace existing files and folders.
-Enjoy your additional palettes.
